# Iteration Notes for feature/53-esp32-dht22-to-sht30-migration

## Iteration 1: 2025-09-30 20:40:07

**Summary of Actions:**
* Successfully migrated ESP32 template from DHT22 single-wire sensor to SHT30 I2C sensor for ESP32-S3 compatibility
* Replaced DHT library includes with Wire.h and Adafruit_SHT4x.h
* Configured I2C pins: SDA=GPIO8, SCL=GPIO9 (hardcoded for ESP32-S3)
* Updated sensor initialization from DHT to SHT4x with I2C communication
* Modified sensor reading methods to use sensors_event_t structures
* Removed "gpio" field from JSON response as requested
* Updated "sensor" field from "AM2302" to "SHT30"
* Preserved all template placeholders and medical device compliance patterns
* Maintained mock data fallback behavior for error handling
* Created feature branch and committed all changes
* Pushed branch and created Pull Request #54 to staging

**Issues and Solutions:**
* **Issue Found**: DHT22 is single-wire sensor, not compatible with I2C requirement
* **Solution Applied**: Migrated to SHT30 sensor using Adafruit SHT4x library for native I2C support
* **New Insight/Change**: I2C communication provides more stable sensor readings for medical device applications

**Remaining Tasks (To-Do for Next Iteration):**
1. **Hardware Testing** - Verify SHT30 sensor detection on ESP32-S3 with GPIO8/GPIO9 (Priority High)
2. **API Validation** - Test /sensor endpoint returns valid JSON without gpio field (Priority High)
3. **Integration Testing** - Test template deployment through ESP32 deployment tool (Priority Medium)
4. **Compilation Testing** - Validate generated firmware compiles successfully (Priority Medium)
5. **Medical Device Compliance Review** - Ensure all changes meet medical device standards (Priority High)
