  - Converted 19 `runtimeLogger.info()` calls to proper `await runtimeLogger({...})` format
  - Converted 3 `runtimeLogger.error()` calls to proper format
  - Maintained medical device audit trail compliance

- **Phase 2**: Fixed all 19 instances in `main/ku-controllers/BuildTimeController.ts`
  - Converted 16 `runtimeLogger.info()` calls to proper format
  - Converted 3 `runtimeLogger.error()` calls to proper format
  - Preserved hardware controller logging integrity

- **Phase 3**: Validation and Testing
  - Successfully ran `npm run build` with zero TypeScript errors
  - Tested development server functionality
  - Verified logging system maintains medical device compliance

- **Phase 4**: Git Workflow
  - Created feature branch `feature/7-fix-runtimelogger-typescript-errors`
  - Committed changes with comprehensive commit message
  - Created Pull Request #8 with detailed description
  - Maintained proper medical device development workflow

## AI Diary

I started this session by examining the TypeScript compilation errors related to `runtimeLogger` usage. My initial understanding was that there were incorrect method calls like `runtimeLogger.info()` and `runtimeLogger.error()` being used instead of the proper `await runtimeLogger({...})` format with a `RuntimeLogData` object.

My first step was to examine the `runtime-logger.ts` file to understand the correct function signature. I discovered that `runtimeLogger` is an async function that takes a `RuntimeLogData` interface as input, which includes properties like `user`, `message`, `logType`, `component`, `level`, and `metadata`. This was crucial for understanding how to properly convert the incorrect usage patterns.

I then used a systematic approach to identify all instances across the codebase. I started with `scripts/build-prep.ts` and found 22 instances that needed fixing. The pattern was consistent: calls like `runtimeLogger.info('message', { details })` needed to be converted to `await runtimeLogger({ user: 'system', message: 'message', logType: 'build', component: 'build-prep', level: 'info', metadata: { details } })`.

During the conversion process, I realized the importance of maintaining the medical device audit trail compliance. Each log entry needed to include proper user attribution, component identification, and metadata preservation. I was careful to maintain the original error context and debugging information while converting to the new format.

The most challenging part was ensuring I captured all the nuanced information from the original logging calls. Some calls had complex metadata objects that needed to be properly nested within the new `metadata` property. I had to be particularly careful with error logging to preserve stack traces and error details.

After completing the fixes in both files, I ran the build process to validate that all TypeScript errors were resolved. The successful build gave me confidence that the changes were correct and complete. I then tested the development server to ensure the logging functionality still worked properly in runtime.

My approach changed slightly as I progressed through the files. Initially, I was being very cautious and fixing small batches, but I realized I could be more efficient by grouping related changes together while still maintaining accuracy.

## Honest Feedback

Overall, I performed well on this task with a systematic and thorough approach. My efficiency was good - I completed all 41 fixes across two files in a reasonable timeframe while maintaining accuracy and medical device compliance standards.

**Strengths:**
- Systematic approach to identifying and fixing all instances
- Proper understanding of the `RuntimeLogData` interface requirements
- Maintained medical device audit trail compliance throughout
- Thorough validation with build testing and runtime verification
- Proper Git workflow with descriptive commits and comprehensive PR

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Could have been slightly more efficient by batching similar changes together from the start
- Initial examination could have been more comprehensive to get a complete count upfront
- Could have provided more detailed progress updates during the lengthy conversion process

**Tool Limitations Encountered:**
- The `update_file` tool required multiple calls for large files due to output limits
- Had to break down the fixes into smaller chunks, which extended the process
- Search tools worked well for identifying patterns across the codebase

**Communication Clarity:**
My communication was clear and structured, providing regular updates on progress and maintaining transparency about the medical device compliance requirements. I properly explained the technical changes and their importance for the healthcare application context.

**Suggestions for Future Similar Tasks:**
1. Perform a more comprehensive initial scan to get accurate counts
2. Group similar changes more efficiently while maintaining accuracy
3. Consider creating utility functions for common conversion patterns
4. Implement automated testing for logging format compliance
