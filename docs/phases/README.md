# DS12 End-to-End Implementation - Phase Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive phase documentation for implementing complete DS12 hardware support in the SMC medical device management system. The implementation follows a structured approach to replace the existing legacy controller with modern DS12 controller architecture.

## Project Context

- **Hardware**: DS12 (12-slot medical device dispenser)
- **Current Status**: Protocol parser complete (Phase 1), ready for controller implementation
- **Technology Stack**: Electron + Next.js + Sequelize + node-serialport
- **Compliance**: Medical device standards with audit logging
- **Testing**: Real DS12 hardware available for validation

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation is broken down into logical phases with atomic tasks, detailed success criteria, and clear dependencies. Each phase builds upon previous phases while maintaining system stability.

## Phase Structure

Each phase document contains:

- **Objective**: Clear goal and deliverables
- **Prerequisites**: Dependencies and required completions
- **Task Breakdown**: Atomic, actionable tasks with time estimates
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable completion requirements
- **Testing Requirements**: Validation and quality assurance
- **Risk Mitigation**: Known challenges and solutions
- **Next Phase Preparation**: Setup for subsequent phases

## Phase Overview

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Comprehensive error handling with ProtocolResponse<T> pattern
- Medical device audit logging for all operations
- 90%+ test coverage requirement
- Performance benchmarks documented

### Architecture Principles
- Separation of concerns between protocol, controller, and UI layers
- Factory pattern for device type selection
- Strategy pattern for protocol parsing
- Observer pattern for state management
- Dependency injection for testability

### Security Requirements
- Role-based access control for critical operations
- Passkey validation for all slot operations
- Audit trail for all hardware interactions
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure IPC communication patterns

## Implementation Team Roles

- **Project Architect**: Overall system design and phase planning
- **Protocol Specialist**: Parser implementation and hardware integration
- **Controller Developer**: Device controller and state management
- **IPC Developer**: Inter-process communication and event handling
- **Database Developer**: Schema design and model implementation
- **UI Developer**: Frontend integration and user experience
- **QA Engineer**: Testing, validation, and compliance verification

## Progress Tracking

Use these commands to track progress:
```bash
# Update task status in phase documents
# Mark tasks as: pending, in_progress, completed, blocked

# Example task status indicators:
# ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending - Not yet started
# üîÑ In Progress - Currently being worked on
# ‚úÖ Completed - Successfully finished and tested
# ‚ùå Blocked - Waiting for dependency or resolution
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues - Completed but with known issues
```
