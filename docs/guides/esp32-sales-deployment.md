   Individual JSON file:
   - customer-BGK001-2025-08-25.json
   - Contains single customer configuration
   
   Daily CSV file:
   - esp32-deployments-2025-08-25.csv  
   - Contains all customers deployed today
   - Automatically updates with each deployment

3. File locations:
   - C:\esp32-deployment-tool\exports\
   - Files are automatically timestamped
   - Each deployment adds to daily CSV
```

**Export File Contents:**
```
CSV includes:

## ðŸ”§ Windows-Specific Issues & Solutions

### Command Prompt Issues

**Issue:** "Command not found" or "'npm' is not recognized"
```
Solution:
1. Restart Command Prompt
2. Check Node.js installation: node --version
3. If still failing, add Node.js to PATH:
   - Control Panel â†’ System â†’ Advanced System Settings
   - Environment Variables â†’ System Variables
   - Find PATH â†’ Edit â†’ Add Node.js installation folder
   - Usually: C:\Program Files\nodejs\
```

**Issue:** Command Prompt closes automatically
```
Solution:
1. Don't close Command Prompt while tool is running
2. Minimize instead of closing
3. If accidentally closed, restart: npm run dev
```

### Windows Firewall Issues

**Issue:** Browser cannot connect to localhost:3000
```
Solution:
1. Windows Defender Firewall notification may appear
2. Click "Allow access" when prompted
3. If no prompt appears:
   - Control Panel â†’ Windows Defender Firewall
   - Allow an app through firewall â†’ Change settings
   - Find Node.js â†’ Check "Private" and "Public"
   - Click OK
```

### USB Connection Issues

**Issue:** ESP32 connects/disconnects repeatedly
```
Solution:
