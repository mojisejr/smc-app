## Database Lock Issue During Internal Build - Investigation and Resolution

### Problem Description
Database lock error occurring during `npm run build:internal:ds12` command:
```
EBUSY: resource busy or locked, unlink 'D:\dev\smc\smc-app\resources\db\database.db'
```

### Key Issues Identified
1. **Database Lock Error**: Cannot delete database.db file during build preparation
2. **Outdated Troubleshooting**: Error message still references SHARED_SECRET_KEY which is no longer used
3. **Build Process Interruption**: Internal build fails at database cleanup stage

### Investigation Plan
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify all possible causes of database lock
2. **Systematic Resolution**: Fix issues in order of confidence level
3. **Testing Protocol**: Test build after each fix to ensure no breaking changes
4. **Focus**: Internal build only - no impact on other build processes

### Critical Requirements
- Build must pass completely
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Focus specifically on internal build process
- Update outdated troubleshooting messages

### Medical Device Context
This affects the production build process for the Smart Medication Cart system, requiring careful handling to maintain medical device compliance and audit trail integrity.
